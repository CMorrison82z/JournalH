- Option to add entries via Cli (rather than a temporary file).
  This has use case for automated journaling

- Ability to specify another time for the journal entry (Ex. `yesterday: Did something important.`)
- Templates. Specify a template format for a journal entry
- Filter on time as well as tags
- Filter on entry content (does it contain a certain phrase or regex)
- Exclusion filter
- Modification commands (edit, delete, etc.) that respect a searh.
  I.e., edit only entries searched for from the given filters.
- A "brief" option for displaying journal entries (just shows title or something?)
